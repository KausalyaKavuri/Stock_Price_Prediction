Predicting the Stock Prices using Topic Analysis


Predicting future stock prices using predictive analysis can be beneficial for obtaining returns on investments. We analyzed potentially existing topic about politics and economics in the daily news and predicted future stock prices based on the results of the topic analysis. The business goal of our project is to predict the future DJIA Index, from the results of a time series forecasting model and a topic analysis of the daily news. 


In our approach, we used two models: 

#### The ARIMA model, which is a pure time series model.

#### The ARIMAX model, which combines the time series model with the prediction of the objective variable.
